### *Project 1: Investigate a Relational Database*
*Description*
During this project, I ran SQL queries based on a database of movie rentals and built visualizations to demonstrate the output of their queries.
In order to complete the presentation component, the student had to create four slides, each containing (a) a question of interest, (b) a SQL query to answer the question, (c) a visualization based on the final results of the SQL queries that answered the question, and (d) a small summary.



### Description
This project consisted in using Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2.
The Project Submission consisted in the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
